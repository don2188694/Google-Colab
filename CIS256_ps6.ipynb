        "### Background: Viruses, Drug Treatments, and Computational Models\n",
        "Viruses such as HIV and H1N1 represent a significant challenge to modern medicine. One of the reasons that they are so difficult to treat is their ability to evolve.\n",
        "\n",
        "As you may know from introductory biology classes, the traits of an organism are determined by its genetic code. When organisms reproduce, their offspring will inherit genetic information from their parent. This genetic information will be modified, either because of mixing of the two parents' genetic information, or through mutations in the genome replication process, thus introducing diversity into a population.\n",
        "\n",
        "Viruses are no exception. Two characteristics of viruses make them particularly difficult to treat. The first is that their replication mechanism often lacks the error checking mechanisms that are present in more complex organisms. This speeds up the rate of mutation. Secondly, viruses replicate extremely quickly (orders of magnitude faster than humans) -- thus, while we may be used to thinking of evolution as a process which occurs over long time scales, populations of viruses can undergo substantial evolutionary changes within a single patient over the course of treatment.\n",
        "\n",
        "These two characteristics allow a virus population to acquire genetic resistance to therapy quickly. In this problem set, we will make use of simulations to explore the effect of introducing drugs on the virus population and determine how best to address these treatment challenges within a simplified model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Computational modeling has played an important role in the study of viruses such as HIV (for example, see this paper, by MIT graduate David Ho). In this problem, we will implement a highly simplified stochastic model of virus population dynamics. Many details have been swept under the rug (host cells are not explicitly modeled and the size of the population is several orders of magnitude less than the size of actual virus populations). Nevertheless, our model exhibits biologically relevant characteristics and will give you a chance to analyze and interpret interesting simulation data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Spread of a Virus in a Person\n",
        "In reality, diseases are caused by viruses and have to be treated with medicine, so in the remainder of this problem set, we'll be looking at a detailed simulation of the spread of a virus within a person. We've provided you with skeleton code in ps5b.py.\n",
        "  \n",
        "# Problem 1: Implementing a Simple Simulation (No Drug Treatment)\n",
        "\n",
        "We start with a trivial model of the virus population - the patient does not take any drugs and the viruses do not acquire resistance to drugs. We simply model the virus population inside a patient as if it were left untreated.\n",
        "\n",
        "### SimpleVirus class\n",
        "To implement this model, you will need to fill in the SimpleVirus class, which maintains the state of a single virus particle. You will implement the methods `__init__`, `getMaxBirthProb`, `getClearProb`,`doesClear`, and `reproduce` according to the specifications. Use `random.random()` for generating random numbers to ensure that your results are consistent with ours.\n",
        "\n",
        "`Hint: random seed`\n",
        "\n",
        "The reproduce method in SimpleVirus should produce an offspring by returning a new instance of SimpleVirus with probability: `self.maxBirthProb * (1 - popDensity)`. This method raises a `NoChildException` if the virus particle does not reproduce. For a reminder on raising execptions, review the Python docs.\n",
        "\n",
        "`self.maxBirthProb` is the birth rate under optimal conditions (the virus population is negligible relative to the available host cells so there is ample nourishment available). popDensity is defined as the ratio of the current virus population to the maximum virus population for a patient and should be calculated in the update method of the Patient class.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Patient class\n",
        "You will also need to implement the `Patient` class, which maintains the state of a virus population associated with a patient.\n",
        "\n",
        "The update method in the Patient class is the inner loop of the simulation. It modifies the state of the virus population for a single time step and returns the total virus population at the end of the time step. At every time step of the simulation, each virus particle has a fixed probability of being cleared (eliminated from the patient's body). If the virus particle is not cleared, it is considered for reproduction. If you utilize the population density correctly, you shouldn't need to provide an explicit check that the virus population exceeds maxPop when you are calculating how many offspring are added to the population -- you just calculate the new population density and use that for the next call to update.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike the clearance probability, which is constant, the probability of a virus particle reproducing is a function of the virus population. With a larger virus population, there are fewer resources in the patient's body to facilitate reproduction, and the probability of reproduction will be lower. One way to think of this limitation is to consider that virus particles need to make use of a patient's cells to reproduce; they cannot reproduce on their own. As the virus population increases, there will be fewer available host cells for viruses to utilize for reproduction.\n",
        "\n",
        "To summarize, update should first decide which virus particles are cleared and which survive by making use of the `doesClear` method of each `SimpleVirus` instance, then update the collection of SimpleVirus instances accordingly. With the surviving `SimpleVirus` instances, update should then call the `reproduce` method for each virus particle. Based on the population density of the surviving SimpleVirus instances, reproduce should either return a new instance of SimpleVirus representing the offspring of the virus particle, or raise a `NoChildException` indicating that the virus particle does not reproduce during the current time step. The update method should update the attributes of the patient appropriately under either of these conditions. After iterating through all the virus particles, the update method returns the number of virus particles in the patient at the end of the time step.\n",

        "Code Reflection: Describe the purpose of code, techniques implemented to solve problems, challenges encountered, and approaches to overcome the challenges.\n",
        "Pseudocode or Flowchart: Provide a pseudocode or flowchart description of the code that is clear and understandable and captures accurate logic to translate to the programming language.\n",
        "Specifications and Correctness: Source code must meet its specifications and behave as desired. Correct code produces the correct output as defined by the data and problem. However, you should also produce fully functioning code with no errors that aligns with as many of the specifications as possible. You should write your code in a way that the submitted file executes, even if it does not produce the correct output. You will be given credit for partially correct output that can be viewed and seen to be partially correct.\n",
        "Annotation and Documentation: All code should also be well commented. Commenting is a practiced art that requires striking a balance between commenting everything, which adds unneeded noise to the code, and commenting nothing. Well-annotated code requires you to perform the following actions:\n",
        "Explain the purpose of lines or sections of your code, detailing the approach and method you took to achieve a specific task in the code.\n",
        "Document any section of code that is producing errors or incorrect results.\n",
        "Modular and Reusable: Programmers should develop code that is modular and reusable. Code is more flexible and maintainable if it contains functionality and responsibility in distinct methods. Your code should adhere to the single responsibility principle. Classes and methods should do only one job. If you can use a different method without changing other parts of your code, you have succeeded in creating modular methods.\n",
        "Readability: Code needs to be readable to a knowledgeable programmer. In this course, readable code requires the following characteristics:\n",
        "Consistent, appropriate whitespace (blank lines, spaces) and indentation to separate distinct parts of the code and operations\n",
        "Explicit, consistent variable names, which should clearly indicate the data they hold and be formatted consistently, for example, numOrders (camelCase) or item_cost (underscored)\n",
