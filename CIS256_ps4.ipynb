        "Pseudocode or Flowchart: Provide a pseudocode or flowchart description of the code that is clear and understandable and captures accurate logic to translate to the programming language.\n",
        "Specifications and Correctness: Source code must meet its specifications and behave as desired. Correct code produces the correct output as defined by the data and problem. However, you should also produce fully functioning code with no errors that aligns with as many of the specifications as possible. You should write your code in a way that the submitted file executes, even if it does not produce the correct output. You will be given credit for partially correct output that can be viewed and seen to be partially correct.\n",
        "Annotation and Documentation: All code should also be well commented. Commenting is a practiced art that requires striking a balance between commenting everything, which adds unneeded noise to the code, and commenting nothing. Well-annotated code requires you to perform the following actions:\n",
        "Explain the purpose of lines or sections of your code, detailing the approach and method you took to achieve a specific task in the code.\n",
        "Document any section of code that is producing errors or incorrect results.\n",
        "Modular and Reusable: Programmers should develop code that is modular and reusable. Code is more flexible and maintainable if it contains functionality and responsibility in distinct methods. Your code should adhere to the single responsibility principle. Classes and methods should do only one job. If you can use a different method without changing other parts of your code, you have succeeded in creating modular methods.\n",
        "Readability: Code needs to be readable to a knowledgeable programmer. In this course, readable code requires the following characteristics:\n",
        "Consistent, appropriate whitespace (blank lines, spaces) and indentation to separate distinct parts of the code and operations\n",
        "Explicit, consistent variable names, which should clearly indicate the data they hold and be formatted consistently, for example, numOrders (camelCase) or item_cost (underscored)\n",
